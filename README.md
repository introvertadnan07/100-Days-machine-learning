# 100-Days-machine-learning

A structured 100-day learning project focused on machine learning fundamentals, executed via Jupyter notebooks.

🧭 Overview

This repository documents a day-by-day learning journey in machine learning. Each day’s notebook walks through a new concept, exercise, or small project—building step by step from data handling into modelling and analysis.
The aim is to:

Build a strong foundation in ML concepts.

Gain hands-on experience with data in notebook form.

Track progress over a sustained time period (100 days).

Create a portfolio of notebooks you can revisit and reuse.
